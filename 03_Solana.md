# Solana

Duration: ~2 hours

This lab will take you thru a client-side approach to working with the
Solana blockchain.

In this lab you will:

- üîå Connect to a Solana cluster using the web3.js library

- üè¶ Generate a new keypair, then fund the resulting address with an
    airdrop

- üí∏ Transfer tokens between accounts

- ‚õì Deploy and interact with a Solana program (aka Smart Contract),
    written in Rust

1. With your Gitpod ready to use, within the Sample Browser tab, scroll
down until you see the Chains listing.

2. Select Solana.

## Welcome to the Solana Pathway

Read the overview instructions that appear for the Pathway. This first
step does not require you to make any code changes, it's just an
overview of the approach so you know what to expect.

When you've finished reading the overview, look for a large navigation
button labeled Setup the Project near the bottom right of the Sample
Browser panel and select that.

## Setup the project

The first thing you need to do in this step is to install the Solana
CLI. To install the CLI into your GitPod instance, follow these steps:

1. Near the bottom right of the Sample Browser panel, at the top of the
    terminal panel, select the + button and then select bash to create a
    new bash shell instance.\

2. Within the bash shell that appears, paste the following command to
    download and install the Solana CLI.\
    \
    sh -c \"\$(curl -sSfL
    <https://release.solana.com/v1.10.5/install>)\"\
    \

3. When it finishes you will see a note to close and reopen your
    terminal to apply the path changes.

4. Run the following command to add the Solana CLI path to your active
    terminal session:\
    \
    export
    PATH=\"/home/gitpod/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:\$PATH\"

5. Close the bash terminal you just opened by hovering over the word
    bash on the far right of the terminal area and selecting the trash
    icon.\

6. Load a new bash terminal instance by selecting the + button as you
    did before and selecting bash.\

7. Confirm you have Solana installed by running:\
    \
    solana --version

8. You should see output similar to the following:\

Next you will need to get you DataHub API keys. In this step, right
click the Signup for DataHub link and select to open that in new tab in
your browser.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated](./images/media/image11.png)

Switch to that tab and complete the registration for the free DataHub
account.

Login to Datahub with the credentials you created

![Graphical user interface, text, website Description automatically

Return to the Gitpod environment and follow the instructions for
acquiring a DataHub key and adding to your code.

Be sure to select Solana as the protocol when creating your app in
DataHub!

When you have copied the key, you will need to create a .env.local file
in which to store it. Follow these steps:

1.  From the left treeview of the Gitpod environment under the root
    folder /learn-web3-dapp locate the file .env.example.

2.  Right click the file and select Rename. Change the name to just
    .env.local

3.  Double click the .env file to open it in a new editor panel.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically

Paste your key as instructed and close the .env.local tab.

NOTE: Whenever the instructions tell you edit code, look for the code
file in the Explorer tree view just as you did for the .env.example
file.

Select the navigation button Connect to Solana to continue.
