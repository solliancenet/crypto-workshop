# 02 / Creating your first project

Creating a cryptocurrency is a relatively easy thing to do.  Here we will explore the steps necessry to do just that.

## Exercise 1: Starting from scratch - Decisions, decisions

If building a blockchain from scratch, you will need to make some decisions around:

- Consensus mechanism (proof of work or proof of stake)
- Blockchain architecture (nodes, private/public, permissioned or permissionless)
- Code Security (how to avoid fraud and theft)
- Legal Compliance
- How many coins to mint

### Picking a Consensus Mechanism

### Public or Private

### Permission or Permissionless

### Code Security

In lab 03, we will explore some costly mistakes others have made and how to prevent them in your own blockchain.

### Minting Coins

## Exercise 2: Going with the flow

Rather than make the above decisions on your own, you can simply choose an existing blockchain technology and put a new cryptocurrency on top it.  Here are some of the most commons ones:

- Ethereum
- Waves
- Hyperledger Fabric
- NEM
- IBM blockchain
- Nxt
- HydraChain
- BlockStarter
- BigChainDB
- EOS
- Quorum
- IOTA
- CoinList
- MultiChain
- Openchain
- Chain Core

### Option 1: Bitcoin

TODO

### Option 2: Etherum

- Open Visual Studio Code
- Open the `C:\labfiles\crypto-workshop\crypt-currency-eth-starter` folder
- Select **Yes, I trust the authors**
- Open a new terminal window, in the file menu, select **Terminal->New Terminal**
- Run the following commands:

```powershell
npm init
```

- Run the following to install Hardhat:

```powershell
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

- Start the hardhard configuration by running:

```powershell
npx hardhat
```

- Select **Create a basic sample project**, then press **ENTER** through the remaining prompts

- Install TypeChain by running the following commands:

```powershell
npm install --save-dev typechain
```

### Option 3: Solana

TODO

### Option 4: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

## Exercise 3: Making copies

If none of those options sound apealing, then you can choose to build an entire blockchain on your own.

### Option 1: Replicate Bitcoin

### Option 2: Replicate Etherum
