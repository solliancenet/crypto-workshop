This layout can be a little restrictive on a small screen, so begin by
adjusting the layout to give the Sample Browser some more real-estate.
Drag the tab labeled Sample Browser to the left and drop it over the tab
labeled Get Started. Now you should be able to see the browser content
better (as shown in the figure). It's important because this is the view
that you will use to interact with your code changes.

# Solana

Duration: \~2 hours

This lab will take you thru a client-side approach to working with the
Solana blockchain.

In this lab you will:

-   üîå Connect to a Solana cluster using the web3.js library

-   üè¶ Generate a new keypair, then fund the resulting address with an
    airdrop

-   üí∏ Transfer tokens between accounts

-   ‚õì Deploy and interact with a Solana program (aka Smart Contract),
    written in Rust

With your Gitpod ready to use, within the Sample Browser tab, scroll
down until you see the Chains listing.

Select Solana.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
generated](./images/media/image9.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.347916666666667in"}

## Welcome to the Solana Pathway

Read the overview instructions that appear for the Pathway. This first
step does not require you to make any code changes, it's just an
overview of the approach so you know what to expect.

When you've finished reading the overview, look for a large navigation
button labeled Setup the Project near the bottom right of the Sample
Browser panel and select that.

![](./images/media/image42.png){width="6.229484908136483in"
height="3.426388888888889in"}

## Setup the project

The first thing you need to do in this step is to install the Solana
CLI. To install the CLI into your GitPod instance, follow these steps:

1.  Near the bottom right of the Sample Browser panel, at the top of the
    terminal panel, select the + button and then select bash to create a
    new bash shell instance.\
    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
    generated](./images/media/image43.png){width="2.8751476377952754in"
    height="2.3612325021872267in"}

2.  Within the bash shell that appears, paste the following command to
    download and install the Solana CLI.\
    \
    sh -c \"\$(curl -sSfL
    <https://release.solana.com/v1.10.5/install>)\"\
    \
    ![Text Description automatically generated with low
    confidence](./images/media/image44.png){width="6.5in"
    height="1.0451388888888888in"}

3.  When it finishes you will see a note to close and reopen your
    terminal to apply the path changes.

4.  Run the following command to add the Solana CLI path to your active
    terminal session:\
    \
    export
    PATH=\"/home/gitpod/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:\$PATH\"

5.  Close the bash terminal you just opened by hovering over the word
    bash on the far right of the terminal area and selecting the trash
    icon.\
    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
    generated](./images/media/image45.png){width="1.3959055118110235in"
    height="2.013992782152231in"}

6.  Load a new bash terminal instance by selecting the + button as you
    did before and selecting bash.\
    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message
    Description automatically
    generated](./images/media/image46.png){width="3.2987806211723534in"
    height="2.3820669291338583in"}

7.  Confirm you have Solana installed by running:\
    \
    solana --version

8.  You should see output similar to the following:\
    \
    ![](./images/media/image47.png){width="4.833581583552056in"
    height="0.34029527559055117in"}

Next you will need to get you DataHub API keys. In this step, right
click the Signup for DataHub link and select to open that in new tab in
your browser.

Return to the Gitpod environment and follow the instructions for
acquiring a DataHub key and adding to your code.

Be sure to select Solana as the protocol when creating your app in
DataHub!

When you have copied the key, you will need to create a .env.local file
in which to store it. Follow these steps:

1.  From the left treeview of the Gitpod environment under the root
    folder /learn-web3-dapp locate the file .env.example.

2.  Right click the file and select Rename. Change the name to just
    .env.local

3.  Double click the .env file to open it in a new editor panel.

    height="0.9792169728783902in"}

2.  Next copy and paste the following command to install truffle using
    npm:\
    \
    npm install -g truffle

![](./images/media/image70.png){width="5.361386701662292in"
height="0.5555839895013124in"}

3.  Next run the following:\
    \
    cd contracts/polygon/SimpleStorage

4.  Finally, run the following:\
    \
    yarn

When prompted to open a separate terminal window to run the truffle
development blockchain, follow these steps to split the current bash
window:

1.  Hover over bash near the right of the terminal window.

2.  Select the split window icon\

    height="0.9583825459317585in"}

3.  In the new bash terminal, run the following command:\
    \
    truffle develop

When you get to the section titled Deploy the smart contract, you'll
want to make one change to the truffle configuration before following
the instructions to deploy the smart contract to the Mumbai test
network. You need to specify the gas price you are willing to pay for
the deployment. If you do not set this value, you will get a long error
that near the top indicates "transaction underpriced". Follow these
steps:

1.  Open contracts/polygon/SimpleStorage/truffle-config.js

2.  Scroll down into you see the configuration area for matic, and
    between the confirmation and timeoutBlocks keys, add a new key for
    gasPrice that is set for 35 gwei. Your addition should look similar
    to the following:

> ¬† ¬† matic: {
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† provider: () =\>
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new HDWalletProvider({
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // As per the documentation at
> https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/hdwallet-provider#general-usage
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // \"If both mnemonic and private keys are provided, the
> mnemonic is used.\"
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // Therefore, uncomment the following lines to use a
> mnemonic instead of a private key:
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // mnemonic: {
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // ¬† phrase: mnemonic,
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // },
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† privateKeys: \[privateKey\],
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† providerOrUrl: \`https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com\`,
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† chainId: 80001,
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }),
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† network_id: 80001,
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† confirmations: 2,
>
> **¬† ¬† ¬† gasPrice: 35000000000,**
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† timeoutBlocks: 200,
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† skipDryRun: true,
>
> ¬† ¬† ¬† chainId: 80001,
>
> ¬† ¬† },

When you have migrated your smart contract, which causes the deployment
to the Mumbai test network, the output will provide the smart contract
address. Copy that value, paste it into the contact address textbox and
select Check deployment. Success should look similar to the following:

Select the navigation button Restore your account to continue.

## Restore your account

If you have reached this step in the lab, congratulations you have
completed the pathway! You can optionally choose to restore your wallet
from the mnemonic, but only do this if you are using a test wallet not
associated with any actual crypto assets.
